The project simulates a classic game where the player competes against the computer. It uses Python’s `random` library to generate computer moves and applies conditional logic to determine the outcome.

### 🧠 Key Concepts
- Random number generation (`randint`)
- Lists and data structures
- Conditional statements
- User input and formatted output
- Basic game logic implementation

### 🕹️ How to Play
Run the program and type your choice of **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** to see if you can beat the computer!
